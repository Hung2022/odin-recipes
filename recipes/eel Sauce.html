    <h3> Eel sauce is also called nitsume or kabayaki sauce, and unagi no tare in Japanese. It's a sweet and salty sauce that goes great over grilled fish or chicken and is a common drizzle over sushi. Traditionally it is used on Japanese grilled eel and eel rolls. I also use this sauce over fresh cooked noodles for a quick snack. A half cup of dashi may be added to create a richer, more authentic flavor. (Dashi is a Japanese stock that is best made at home.)</h3>
