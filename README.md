# odin-recipes
1st Project for Odin Recipes

-Before:<br>
Demonstrate how I use HTML. 
I also get more practice on how to use git and upload the files on to git where everyone can see.

-Reflection: <br>
Remembering "br" tag, had to use it to get text under the image instead of next to it<br>
Remembering which folder I'm on, so when I link other files I know where to navigate/link next.<br>
I often go all out or go in depth when I see the product is not what I want. But with this project:<br> 
-I learned to build out the minimum.<br>
-Added in small new things without go in deep into the rabbit hole.<br>
-Result -> A minimal product, practiced the concept + new concept outside of learning, while not burning out.<br>
