# odin-recipes
1st Project for Odin Recipes

-Before
Demonstrate how I use HTML. 
I also get more practice on how to use git and upload the files on to git where everyone can see.

-Reflection
Remembering tag <br>, had to use it to get text under the image instead of next to it
Remembering which folder I'm on, so when I link other files I know where to navigate/link next.
I often go all out or go in depth when I see the product is not what I want. But with this project: 
-I learned to build out the minimum.
-Added in small new things without go in deep into the rabbit hole.
-Result -> A minimal product, practiced the concept + new concept outside of learning, while not burning out.
